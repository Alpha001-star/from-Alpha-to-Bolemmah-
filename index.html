      <h2>My Dearest Bolemmah 💖</h2>

      <p>
        As this little box opens, my heart opens even wider to you.
        Every star in this sky reminds me of the light you brought
        into my life — softly, beautifully, and all at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are my calm in chaos, my laughter on difficult days,
        and the place my heart feels safest.
        Loving you has been the most natural and beautiful
        decision I have ever made.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I think about tomorrow, about 2026 and all the years
        beyond, I don’t see a future without you in it.
        I see us — growing, dreaming, learning, and choosing
        each other every single day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for being you, for loving me the way you do,
        and for making my world warmer just by being in it.
      </p>

      <p class="signature">
        Always and forever,<br>
        <strong>Alpha 💙</strong>
